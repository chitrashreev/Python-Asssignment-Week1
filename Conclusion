Conclusion

This assignment provided hands-on experience with core Python programming
concepts relevant to Data Science and AI. Through the exercises, I worked
with date and time operations, numerical logic, file handling, NumPy data
processing, and API integration.

Completing this assignment improved my understanding of writing structured,
readable, and error-resilient Python programs. It also strengthened my
confidence in applying Python to real-world data processing tasks and
reinforced best practices such as modular coding and secure API usage.
