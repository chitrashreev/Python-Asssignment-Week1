Introduction

This assignment is designed to assess fundamental Python programming skills
required for Data Science and AI roles. It covers practical problem-solving
tasks including date and time manipulation, numerical computation, string
processing, file handling, use of NumPy, and interaction with external APIs.

By completing this assignment, I aim to strengthen my understanding of
structured programming, error handling, and writing clean, readable,
well-documented Python code suitable for real-world applications.
